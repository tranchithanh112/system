First released in Release 2017-01-15 (6.0.1.3)\Update 01.
=========================================================

In this folder the latest versions of standard mimics files for you to use in your projects are available.

To use the mimic/frame or color table you can:

1) Copy the file from \System\Setup\Mimics\Lib into \System\Setup\Mimics\Project before including it into your own mimic. On this manner you can be sure that the file will remain same even during future updates this software.

2) Directly use the mimic (frame) in \System\Setup\Mimics\Lib. On this manner it may change in the future if Innovation department includes improved Mimic files.
